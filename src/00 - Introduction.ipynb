    "According to Zentralverband Deutsches Kfz-Gewerbe (ZDK) that stands for Central Association of German Motor Trades, the market os used cars in Germany overcame new cars sales in 2016. Used cars trades supposed €67.6 billion in sales in front of €61.1 billion of new cars. This amount was 17% higher than previous year and confirms the trend observed in the past years: more and more people are considering second hand cars as a good option when they want to acquire or change their vehicle. Only ten years ago, new cars market in Germany doubled used cars, and thirty years ago, tripled.  "

    "One of the reasons of this growing market can be found in the economical crisis started in 2008 that forced people to save money in a uncertain scenario. The expansion in penetration of internet over the population helped too to develop secondary markets. I front of organised markets where brands controlled distribution, trade and promotional policies, appeared an infinity of little markets which escaped to brands control. Now, webs or even mobile apps, allow sellers and buyers to find each other and trade freely. Entering in a car dealership you have access to two or three different models according to your budget. Entering in a web portal of used cars puts at your disposal a wide catalog of brands and models, so the business opportunity is huge if you can attract many potential clients."

    "Cars are complex products to buy / sell. There are a lot of different variables that that can be taken into account before making a decision: brand, type of car, type of fuel, power of the engine, included equipment or color. When the car is used we can add some more variables to the equation, like kilometers or antique, and even if the car is damaged! So it's very difficult to precise the market price with accuracy. We could set an excessively expensive sale price for our car and never get to sell it, or otherwise, sell it underrated and not make money. Of course we could so some research and getting an estimate average of the sale price for a particular car, but for issues like that machine learning could help better."
